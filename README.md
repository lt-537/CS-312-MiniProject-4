# CS-312-MiniProject-4

The objective of this assignment was to enhance the blog application built in MiniProject 3 by implementing React.js. Each ejs file has been replaced completely by .jsx files, calling for a restructuring of the server-side index.js file. The application was built on an existing PostgreSQL database, and with given feedback in the last project, I had integrated the use of sessions (rather than using global variables) to remember the current user across multiple requests.

## NOTE: How to run
For this project I decided to use two directories called "frontend" and "backend". Each will execute differently and I will guide on how to run the application.

### Front-end Side 
After cloning & installing the packages, you should run something like this to get the frontend running (packages should also be installed in this path): 
  Tish@lpt-lt MINGW64 ~/Documents/miniProject4/CS-312-MiniProject-4/frontend/blog-app (main)
  $ npm start

### Back-end side
Same here, after cloning & installing packages on this path:
Tish@lpt-lt MINGW64 ~/Documents/miniProject4/CS-312-MiniProject-4/backend (main)
$ npm start


### Example User Creds
Here is an example user cred for testing:

Login Using:
  UserId: 312
  Pass: i_am_user
  UserName: user123
