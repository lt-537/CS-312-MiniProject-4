# CS-312-MiniProject-4

The objective of this assignment was to enhance the blog application built in MiniProject 3 by implementing React.js. Each ejs file has been replaced completely by .jsx files, calling for a restructuring of the server-side index.js file. The application was built on an existing PostreSQL database, and with given feedback in the last project, I had integrated the use of sessions (rather than using global variables) to remember the current user across multiple requests.
